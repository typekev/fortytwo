# [Forty Two - code for fun!](https://forty-two.netlify.com/)

Code against your friends!

The goal is to see who can complete their objective first. You each get forty two alterations each turn. But watch out: you'll be working in the same file!
Try to outwit your component by using their own code against them!

By the way, don't delay; after 30 seconds your alterations will start to dwindle by the second ;)

Have fun!

### How to play

Read the OBJECTIVE and write function to solve the given problem.
Each time you press a key (or each second after 30 seconds) your remaining alterations will be reduced by one.
Once you exhaust your alterations you will no longer be able to type.
You will see your remaining alterations in the top right corner of the screen, you start with 42.

When you finish writing your solution (or run out of alterations) you can end your turn by running the following sequence of commands in the TERMINAL

```
git add .
git commit -m '[message]'
git push
```

After you push, you will see the results of your code under OUTPUT

If your solution is correct you win!
